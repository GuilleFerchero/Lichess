## LICHESS

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#Limpiamos memoria

rm(list = ls())

#Instalamos Librer√≠as

#install.packages("DT")
library("DT")
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(kableExtra)
library(plotly)
library("chessR")

# Levantamos ultimos datos
Datos <- get_raw_lichess("Guillebarracas")
base <- write.csv(lichess_game_data, "base.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
